## Introduction

- What are model cards, and why do we need them?

Model cards are a list of information about the newly developed ML models, with the purpose of encouraging safe/ethical use of such systems by transparent model reporting. As many novel applications of ML continue to emerge, ML research community should do their best to minimize the negative impact of their work.

- Why do we need a list of papers that have a model card?

**UPDATE (2021.03.16)**: After uploading this repo on Twitter and Reddit, I soon became aware of another list which had already begun tracking the list of papers with model cards: [ivylee/model-cards-and-datasheets](https://github.com/ivylee/model-cards-and-datasheets). Fortunately, turns out there are already tens of papers with model card.

At the time of writing (Mar. 2021), to my best knowledge, less than 10 papers did actually make the card for their model, where the model card paper itself was cited more than 250 times. To encourage the actual adoption of the model card, I decided to make and maintain the list of papers with model cards here.

## List of papers with model card

**UPDATE (2021.03.16)**: Initially, I was unaware of another awesome list at GitHub, which is far more comprehensive. (I should have done more search on GitHub!) From now, I will send PR to the following repository instead of maintaining duplicated list here. Therefore I'm removing the list below.

## Contributing

Found a missing paper in the list? Willing to have some healthy discussion? Please make an Issue or Pull Request here.

Since I'm not fully dedicated on maintaining this repository, it may take some time to respond to the Issues/PRs here. However, I'll be eventually reviewing them since one of my core values are ensuring the safe/ethical usage of such advanced technology.
